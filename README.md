Final Project In IBM internship

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Create a robust network intrusion detection system (NIDS) using machine 
learning. The system should be capable of analyzing network traffic data to 
identify and classify various types of cyber-attacks (e.g., DoS, Probe, R2L, U2R) 
and distinguish them from normal network activity. The goal is to build a model 
that can effectively secure communication networks by providing an early 
warning of malicious activities.

PROPOSED SOLUTION
Develop a machine learning model for analysing network traffic data to identify and 
classify various types of cyber-attacks and distinguish them from normal network 
activity .The model can effectively secure communication networks by providing an 
early warning of malicious activities.
▪ Key components:
o Data collection: Data set collection from Kaggle
o Preprocessing: Clean and normalise the dataset
o Model training: Train a classification model(e.g, Decision Tree, Random Forest, svm)
o Evaluation: validate the model using accuracy, precession, recall and F-1 score.

SYSTEM APPROACH
The "System Approach" section outlines the overall strategy and methodology 
for developing and implementing the Network Intrusion Detection
system. Here's a suggested structure for this section:
System requirements:-
o IBM Cloud (mandotory).
o IBM Watson studio for model development and deployment.
o IBM Cloud object storage for dataset handiling.

Result
In this project, i successfully developed a Machine Learning-based Network Intrusion 
Detection System (NIDS) capable of analyzing network traffic data to detect and classify 
malicious activities. Using a labeled dataset containing various network features and class 
labels (normal vs anomaly), the system learned to differentiate between legitimate traffic and 
potential cyber-attacks.

FUTURE SCOPE
• Multi-Class Attack Classification
Upgrade the system to not only detect anomalies but also classify them into specific attack 
types like DoS, Probe, R2L, and U2R, improving threat identification and response.
• Real-Time Intrusion Detection
Integrate with live network monitoring tools and IBM Event Streams to detect and respond to 
threats in real time, enhancing the system’s practical applicability.
• Explainable AI Integration
Use explainability tools such as SHAP or LIME to make the model’s decisions 
transparent, enabling better trust and understanding by security analysts.
