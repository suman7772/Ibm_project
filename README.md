# Ibm_project
Final Project In IBM internship

PROBLEM STATEMENT:-

Create a robust network intrusion detection system (NIDS) using machine 
learning. The system should be capable of analyzing network traffic data to 
identify and classify various types of cyber-attacks (e.g., DoS, Probe, R2L, U2R) 
and distinguish them from normal network activity. The goal is to build a model 
that can effectively secure communication networks by providing an early 
warning of malicious activities.

PROPOSED SOLUTION:-

Develop a machine learning model for analysing network traffic data to identify and 
classify various types of cyber-attacks and distinguish them from normal network 
activity .The model can effectively secure communication networks by providing an 
early warning of malicious activities.
â–ª Key components:
o Data collection: Data set collection from Kaggle
o Preprocessing: Clean and normalise the dataset
o Model training: Train a classification model(e.g, Decision Tree, Random Forest, svm)
o Evaluation: validate the model using accuracy, precession, recall and F-1 score.
